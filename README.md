# Sysdig Coding Exercise

## Notes

* this was only tested within Chrome as a browser was not specified in the requirements
* I use the `window.fetch` API and the `Array.from` method but this is not fully supported by all browsers at the moment of development
  - polyfills are included and loaded if needed to mitigate this issue
