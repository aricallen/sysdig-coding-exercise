The goal is to build the following single-page application:

* Show a list of events by using the Sysdig Cloud API
* Each event is displayed with all relevant information
* The table is automatically refreshed every 30 seconds and when the user clicks the "Refresh Now" button
* Use CSS to make the UI simple but fairly nice

Here is the documentation about how to use the API: https://sysdig.gitbooks.io/sysdig-cloud-api/content/rest_api/getting_started.html

Here is the API token to use: 8aef9517-3070-4090-b55e-83296cee8cd1

To get the list of events you can use the following API endpoint:

GET https://app-staging.sysdigcloud.com/api/events

Here are specs for an event descriptor:

{
    "id": 123,
    "version": 1,
    "createdOn": 1470083142,
    "modifiedOn": 1470083142,
    "name": "Something happened",
    "description": "More extensive description of the event",
    "severity": 6,
    "timestamp": 1470083142,
    "tags": {
        "node": "ip-1-2-3-4",
        "source": "slack",
        "user": "john"
    }
}
